MessagePack
-----------
Binary-based efficient data interchange format.


*Requirements

  MessagePack is only tested on Linux and Mac OS X, but it may run on other
  UNIX-like platforms.

  Following programs are required to build:
    - gcc >= 4.1 with C++ support
    - ruby >= 1.8   (ruby is used as a preprocessor)


*Installation

  Simply run ./configure && make && make install to install C and C++ binding.

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

  To install Ruby binding, run ./gengem.sh script on ruby/ directory and install
  generated gem package.

    $ cd ruby
    $ ./gengem.sh
    $ gem install gem/pkg/msgpack-*.gem


*Usage

  C++:
    include msgpack.hpp header and link libmsgpack library.
    see example/simple.cc for example.

      g++ simple.cc -lmsgpack
      g++ stream.cc -lmsgpack -lpthread


  C:
    include msgpack.h   header and link libmsgpackc library.
    see example/simple.c  for example.

      gcc simple.c  -lmsgpackc


  Ruby:
    require msgpack library.
    see example/simple.rb for example.

	  ruby -rubygems simple.rb
