MessagePack
-----------
Binary-based efficient data interchange format.


*Requirements

  MessagePack is only tested on Linux and Mac OS X, but it may run on other
  UNIX-like platforms.

  Following programs is required to build:
    - gcc >= 4.0 with C++ support
    - ruby >= 1.8   (ruby is used as a preprocessor)


*Installation

  Simply run ./configure && make && make install to install C and C++ binding.

  $ ./configure --prefix=path/to/prefix
  $ make
  $ make install

  To install Ruby binding, run ./gengem.sh script in ruby/ directory and install
  generated gem package.

  $ cd ruby
  $ ./gengem.sh
  $ gem install gem/pkg/msgpack-*.gem


*Usage

  C++:
    #include <msgpack.hpp>
	// TODO


  C:
    #include <msgpack.h>
	/* TODO */


  Ruby:
    require 'msgpack'

    # serialize
	buf = [1, 2, 3].to_msgpack

    # deserialize
    p MessagePack::unpack(buf)

    # TODO
